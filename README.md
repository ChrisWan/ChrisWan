I'm Chris and welcome to my repository. The purpose of it is to have some place where I can save my previous projects and also can showcase them.
I plan to expand it more as the time passes. My studies piked my interest in Data Science and so I started to learn Python and completed several
online courses to hone my skills but foremost my programming proficiency. My prior knowledge of Java, C# and C++ came in handy.
I’m interested in Data Science and since I gratuated my studies recently I am also looking for a job or other relevant practice in that particular field.
If you want to reach out to me for whatever inquiry, you can always contact me through my e-mail: wanke.christian@googlemail.com. Feel free to write me.
